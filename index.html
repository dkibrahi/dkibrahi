            <p>Aiming to bridge the gap between imagination and reality through software. <br><br>Currently studying at the University of Michigan, I plan on majoring in Computer Science and become a Software Developer. To prepare for this, I am currently exploring multiple projects and internship oppertunities to gain as much experience plausible. Although I have completed multiple projects both in and outside of class, I have showcased the projects I am most proud of below. My projects showcase my diverse skillset in both technical and non-technical areas. Please take your time viewing what I have created!</p>

                <h3>DJ 183</h3>
                <p>Given only a few weeks to do so, I lead a team of 4 to create an online music quizzer. Wary of how important teamwork and communication is, I created a groupchat to communicate on and set up meetings at least twice a week. Once everyone knew what to work on, we set off to create the best website possible. I took on the role of styling the website using bootstrap, CSS keyframing, and general CSS styling properties. The team worked on using Flask to pull a preview of a song from a billboard API, give the user 4 options to choose from to try and then have the user guess the song that was played. Flask was also used to keep track of the user's score. Regardless of whether the user got the answer right or wrong, the lyrics of the correct song were displayed after the user made their choice through the use of beautifulsoup. Lastly, the team used google firebase to create a leaderboard of scores.</p>

                <h3>Ping Pong Master</h3>
                <p>In attempt to improve my Javascript skills, I have built a ping-pong simulation. Following a tutorial to do so, I built this application in under a hour. Unsatisfied with the final product, I decided to style the website and make it more appealing to the eye. Although the final product is much better than it once was, I still yearn to add more of my own personal touch to it. As I learn more javascript, I will continue adding more features to this game (i.e. adding a main menu and a level selector for difficulty).</p>
