Hello stranger! My name is Daniel Kareem Ibrahim. I currently attend the University of Michigan and would love if you took to the time to check out my personal website. 

There, you can learn more about me, look at some of the cool projects I have been working on, and even find my contact information if you want to get in touch. The website is live at https://dkibrahi.github.io/dkibrahi/. 

Make sure to check it out!
